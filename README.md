We eat, drink, sleep and most importantly love **DevOps**. We are working towards strategies for standardizing architecture while ensuring security for the infrastructure. We are strong believer of the philosophy <b>Bigger problems are always solved by breaking them into smaller manageable problems</b>. Resonating with microservices architecture, it is considered best-practice to run database, cluster, storage in smaller <b>connected yet manageable pieces</b> within the infrastructure. 

This module is basically combination of [Terraform open source](https://www.terraform.io/) and includes automatation tests and examples. It also helps to create and improve your infrastructure with minimalistic code instead of maintaining the whole infrastructure code yourself.

We have [*fifty plus terraform modules*][terraform_modules]. A few of them are comepleted and are available for open source usage while a few others are in progress.




## Prerequisites

This module has a few dependencies: 

- [Terraform 1.x.x](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html)
- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install)
- [github.com/stretchr/testify/assert](https://github.com/stretchr/testify)
- [github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest/modules/terraform](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest)







## Examples


**IMPORTANT:** Since the `master` branch used in `source` varies based on new modifications, we suggest that you use the release versions [here](https://github.com/clouddrove/terraform-aws-cost-billing-alarm/releases).


Here is examples of how you can use this module in your inventory structure:

  environment               = "test"
  label_order               = ["name", "environment"]
  monthly_billing_threshold = 10
  currency                  = "USD"
  }
```

  label_order               = ["name", "environment"]
  aws_env                   = var.aws_profile
  aws_account_id            = 111111111111
  monthly_billing_threshold = 500
  currency                  = "USD"
  }
```

  monthly_billing_threshold = 500
  currency                  = "USD"
  aws_sns_topic_arn         = ["arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:111111111111:function:bb-root-org-notify_slack"]
  }
```

### cloudwatch-billing-alert-to-pre-existing-sns-with-acct-id
```hcl

## Testing
In this module testing is performed with [terratest](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest) and it creates a small piece of infrastructure, matches the output like ARN, ID and Tags name etc and destroy infrastructure in your AWS account. This testing is written in GO, so you need a [GO environment](https://golang.org/doc/install) in your system. 

You need to run the following command in the testing folder:
```hcl
  go test -run Test
```
